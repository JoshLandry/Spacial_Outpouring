$C1Will you help me find my friend's cat $BBoink$b?  He ran off some place...  You know how cats get about nooks and crannies.

I think if you take a running leap through those $Bcolumns of water$b, and time it just right, you might be able to find the right ledge...  There's a strange momentum to this place.

I last saw him slinking somewhere at the far end of that long, high-ceilinged room there.
