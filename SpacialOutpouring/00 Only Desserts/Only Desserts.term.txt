$C4Hello?  Yes, are you awake?  Ah good, yes, I can see you.  It's been too long since Dogun summoned you.  One could sleep forever in the soft blue glow of this place...  You can see in your map view, it bears the shape a $Bholy relic$b...  but I'm afraid our entire enclave is overrun by disgusting insectoids...?  We're going to need to develop a real strategy and there's $Blittle time for explanation$b.

It's a good thing I found you before $C1Dogun$C4 or some other ill intentioned entity!  Who knows what corner of $Bwonderland$b you could've found yourself in.  I understand it might be a little tempting to $Bpeek beneath the bridge$b, but if you do, be prepared to experience one thousand fold gravity, or some other such utterly unfair nonsense.  His language-less mannerisms allow him to unfeelingly observe his subjects buckle under the pressure.

$C4Essentially I, Salve, and the other caretakers of lower floors, $C7AIN$C4 and $C2Ashita$C4, have $Bcodified$b our corporeal bodies in order to avoid the experience of very real murder at the hands of some rather unsightly creatures.  We have survived, but have lost the ability to interact with the physical world.

If you've any physical strength to do so, I recommend you disembowel every last one of the foul monsters.  We've really no idea where they came from, and it certainly wasn't the fault of any of us three.  I can assure you, the integrity of our $Btrinity$b at least is sound.  $B400 years$b, now, we have existed.

Quickly then, let's be off, I shudder to think of their corrosive yellow bile staining our temple tiles.
