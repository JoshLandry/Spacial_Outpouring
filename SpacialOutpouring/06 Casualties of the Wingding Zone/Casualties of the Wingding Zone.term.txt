$C2Here we are at the deceptively beautiful entrance to the realm of the self-styled $Bporno-shaman$b.  $C4Salve $C2and $C7AIN, $C2whose figurative tentacles involuntarily recoil as they attempt to approach this place, warned me profusely against taking you here.  Even the austere taskmaster, $C1Dogun, $C2attempted to block my transport signal in his inevitable wordless fashion.

$C2Yet if one needs a $Bcoffee crystal$b, this is where one must come.  Such a rare and valuable artifact could only been crafted by a solitary, crooked mind.  This is a being far beyond our power to destroy, and so we must tolerate his existence.

I will give no further information, as it is information here that is dangerous.  Dangerous to know the limits to which the mind can be pushed.  $BDo not listen to what he says$b and perhaps you can come out of here with your soul.

$C5Fractilion's$C2 realm borders this one, and thus you may be hearing from him, as well.  He spends more time in this region than I ever would, and so he may be of help in directing your path.

$C5 I must say, quite unwise of you to bumble on down here without snatching up the sorceror's $Bcoffee crystal$b first.  You're going to take a dip in some boiling goo trying to jump your way out of here.

In all seriousness, though, I think $C2Ashita$C5 was crazy to send you here.  I wouldn't be surprised if the sheer illogic of this place stunted your growth henceforth.  All you need to do is take a look at the female body parts locked into the walls to understand the kind of fate you could meet.  If you're trying to open some doors you might have better luck opening some mouths or eyes first...

$C1"A" has been a good sport about her division across the complex.  Her component parts have been more than cooperative on an individual basis, though seem to possess an as yet unexplained telepathic link of some kind...?  

"C", ever the stubborn one, still refuses to open her eyes unless I give her a little more juice from the $Bmachine room$b, and then looks at me with the fiercest glare, like she might rip herself out of the wall (but of course she can't... ha!).

"E" was another strong will, a problem solved only by the unnatural distance that now exists between her tongue and her toes.

I stare at you through eyes of "E" and "S"...  just like I'd always imagined!  As you walk these halls, you'll see a number of my dreams realized.






You may call me a $Bface pirate$b.  Frankenstein was no monster to me.

$C5What's the matter, are you lost?  The $Bsad puzzle pieces$b will only stare at you.  This place has been still for quite some time.  The $Bcoffee crystal$b throbs nearby (below), but the doors are sealed tight.  A council of three women decide who passes through the entrance.

The wizard has placed high windows throughout the citadel, which he passes through with ease (with aid of the $Bcrystal$b), but can easily deter intruders such as yourself who lack the ability to scale a wall.  My sources tell me it is impossible to reach the $BConsulting Room$b from here (the $BGreen Ring$b) on foot.

You're lucky I'm here to help you.  Back to the $Bwingding zone$b with you, then.

$C5Well then, you've got the crystal.  I wasn't sure you had it in you!  You're going to want to head East and get outside somehow, but if you try to walk through the $BDeath Tunnel(TM)$b you'll likely end up another brightly colored radioactive skull.  He paints them, you know.

Once you get out there it's just a matter of $Bjumping up onto the transporter pad$b.  I'm sure there's got to be some kind of $Bway around$b.

$C1 Take this gift, with love from me.  In time you will learn what my love means.

(The $Bcoffee crystal$b sends a crackle down your spine as you pick it up.  You feel like running a "marathon", or saying "fuck you" to a stranger.)

They may warn you and talk of danger, but there is no separation from the annihilating light of sex.  You are its instrument.
