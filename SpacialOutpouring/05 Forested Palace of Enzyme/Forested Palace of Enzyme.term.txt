$C5Welcome to the $Bforested palace of enzyme$b, my preferred dwelling place.  Historically, it's been a quiet getaway; somewhere I could conduct my business without interference.

I like to be able to hear the whisper of the wind through the leaves; it helps me think.

$C5Lately, I've come to realize I've got more than a few neighbors, and too close for comfort.

Can you imagine the pretense of a being that has named itself $C1'WORLD VOICE'$C5?  But I digress...

$C5Behold, my latest masterpiece, the $BElectric Growgrid$b.  Precisely contructed and perfectly resilient holofoil technology designed to allow trees and other flora to survive under virtually any conditions.

As my corporeal form is lacking at the moment, if you could be a dear and $Braise the grids from the pond$b for their daily drying and information gathering cycle.

You'll need to grab my $Bspring icon$b in order to have the proper permissions to operate the grids from the $Bpump station$b.  I think I left it in the $Bgold room$b on the ledge in the Southwest of the palace.  You walked passed it on your way here.

$C5What's the matter? ...you can't climb up onto the ledge?  Tsk, tsk, I'm disappointed by your lack of resourcefulness.  Don't you have a $Bcoffee crystal$b or some such implement?  You will need one eventually, you know.

Very well, I'll bring you up there myself.

$C5FRACTILION's $C1GROWGRID $BABOMINATIONS$b ARE NOT PERMITTED AT PROXIMITY TO WORLD CENTER.

$C5How dare you use this creature as an instrument to enforce your petty rules!  And over something so benign.  They're trees, god damnit.

$C1YOU KNOW VERY WELL THE TREES ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.

THE POWER ICON WAS $BREMOVED WITHOUT PERMISSION$b.

SAVE YOUR OBSTINANCE FOR A BEING WITH FEELINGS.

YOU ARE HEREBY EXPELLED TO (NEXT MOST DISTANT QUARTER).

$C2This is Ashita.  You are needed elsewhere.  Fractilion jumps at any chance for a squabble with authority. This isn't the best use of your attention.

The place I am taking you could very well annihilate you, but the reward will be great if we succeed.  We are going to steal the most prized possession of a very dark man.
